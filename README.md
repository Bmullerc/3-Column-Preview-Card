## My process

- Started by adding HTML tags and elements aswell as classes for future use.
- Thinking about the layout, in particular how the grid will behave in mobile/desktop view and how to make it work out.
- Working on the css, this time really doing a mobile first workflow
- Working on the active states.
- Testing and refining.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- To use a simple broad class for general purpose and other classes for more specific objectives in the same element. 
- To get more confortable with Grid in general, ideally for media query stuff.
- The use of last/first/nth child to achieve the desired border radius in specific elements.
- To use 'box-shadow inset' to create an inside border that won't shift the element size.
